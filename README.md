Overview
This project is a Laravel 11-based REST API implementing user roles and permissions with Sanctum authentication.
The API includes features like user management, article CRUD, and role/permission based access control.

main: Stable production branch â€” merges from master

You should work locally on master and merge into main when ready.

git clone <repo-url>
git checkout master
Install PHP dependencies:

Make sure you have PHP 8.1+ installed on your machine, then run:

composer install
Set up your .env file:

This will create tables and seed roles, permissions, and three default users.

Seeders Info:

The seeder creates the following roles and users:

Roles: admin, editor, author

Users: Three users are created (see database/seeders for details).

Permissions are also seeded and attached to roles.

Testing the API
I shared a postman file in project base path(apitask.json)

The collection includes:

User registration and login

Role assignment (admin only)

Article CRUD operations

Permission-protected routes

For authenticated requests, include the Bearer Token from login responses.
